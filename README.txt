This is just a small winter break project I am doing to keep my skills up. I'm planning to implement atleast 3 data structres
we covered in class this year. Also, time permitting, I want to add atleast two 'complex' sorts.
They will all be templitized and will have some 'unique' features.

My goals to implement:

Linked List
Hash Table
AVL-Tree
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

If I have time:

B+ Tree
Red-Black Tree
Heap Sort
RaidX Sort

I also plan to make a read me for each template with more detailed instructions about operation / general information.
If I end up thinking the final project is decent, I might upload the package to some websites and hopefully others in the future will be able
to make use of these.
